Alright changes that I think are important:
- There should only be a list and not a seperatae screen for the wine selection
- When opening the app the list should be empty
- At the bottom of the lsit there should be a button to "add a wine"
- when pressing this button, there should be a modal popped up that gives an option to type in the name (and price) of the wine
    but maybe also to take an image or select one
- When typing in a wine it should scrape the parker website
    - It should save all of the presented wines
    - then it should show the wines that are there and give the user the option to select the one that was meant
    - If no wine was found, there is an error with textfield again, so that the user can correct the name
    - Here there should also be a button to "search manually", so that the user can go to the corresponding parker link
- When a wine is selected it should be added to the list so that it can be compared
- The list should be ordered by rating, price or price/rating value
